- design edit menu
	- update data
	- add new types of events
	- should all these features be bundled in the edit menu?
	- fix z-index of timeline events that are updated/added
	- sort events

- Hide Y-Axis visibility

- labels, lines, values
	- make lines have dots
	- fix NaN for hoverline
	- make line labels show event when the data isn't on the far left of the graph

- round up the y-axis-max of values (397->400, 65.5k->70k, 71->80,12.9k->13k,55->60)

- add handles to scrubber and/or lines to graph


CODE CLEANUP
- clean up coded variable names (eg. timeline, events, measures, graph_data)
- clean up efficiency of code
     - (use less opacity tricks and rather use data binding remove tricks)
     - use css to style, not js
     - change evals to preferred convention
